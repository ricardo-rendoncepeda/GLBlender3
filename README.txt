ABOUT
GLBlender1 is the first part of an OpenGL ES & Blender tutorial series, teaching developers how to make an awesome 3D model viewer for iOS that can display models that you create in Blender.
In part 3, get ready to implement a simple lighting model for your 3D scene by writing your own OpenGL ES shaders! A shader is a dedicated program that instructs a graphics processor how to render a scene.
